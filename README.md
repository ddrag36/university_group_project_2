This project aims to predict student performance based on various student characteristics using multiple supervised learning techniques. The primary goal is to forecast the students' "score" based on input features such as study time, gender, and parental education levels. The dataset was split into training and test sets, and various models were evaluated, including Linear Regression, Regression Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and XGBoost. After preprocessing the data and performing cross-validation, the Random Forest model was chosen as the best performer, with the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and highest R-squared value. The final model was used to predict student scores on the test set, demonstrating the predictive power of machine learning techniques in educational data analysis.
